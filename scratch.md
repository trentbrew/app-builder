here’s the rundown:

**editor:** go with **codemirror 6**. it’s modular, leaner, and won’t turn your bundle size into a slow-motion car crash. monaco is nice if you like shipping an entire IDE to the browser.

**scaffold:** just a **single-file svelte REPL**. no need to pretend we’re building a startup from scratch. keep it minimal, keep it sane.

**pnpm vs npm:** **pnpm** is fine. it’s faster and less bloated—basically npm after a personality upgrade.

so yeah. codemirror 6 + single-file svelte repl + pnpm. no bells, no whistles, no startup folder pretending to be a unicorn.

go ahead and wire it up.
